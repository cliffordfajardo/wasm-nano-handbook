# wasm-one-pagers 

!!! WIP.  

This repo is the result of an extended research on WASM.    

### DNA 
Its content aims at being: 
* comprehensive: cover the basics one needs to know to understand WASM, starting from the fundamentals  
* accessible: dev with little knowledge about browser internals and lower-level languages should be able to understand the content here
* unbiased: multiple sources are used 
* modular/digestible: it's split up in small chunks that should fit on ~1 page
* evolutive: this is just the start!  

### Goal 
Make this the starting point for a blog post series / a ref website on WASM.

### Content covered  
* What WASM is and where it comes from 
* The vision (for web and outside of it)
* What one needs to know about how browser work in the context of WASM 
* Refresher on what low-level and high-level is, bytecode, machine code, ...
* Various "use chains" of WASM: "use cases" + "tool chain" 

### Extra 
The `_ideas` file lists talk / blogposts / tools / demo project ideas about WASM, and interesting angles.
