# wasm-nano-handbook

Wasm is a large, ever-expanding territory to explore.

This handbook aims at helping developers, **no matter their background**:

* **Understand** Wasm, its ecosystem and its future // theory
* **Use** it today // practice   

And this, in a **time-efficient** way.    


**🚧 This is WIP, publication to come (GitBook + blogpost series).**

## DNA 
Wasm-nano-handbook strives to be:  

<span style="font-size:larger;">📦</span>**Nano**: as nano as possible for such a wide topic :) The content is split up in small modular chunks, categorized as core or asides. Estimated reading time for the entire core content should remain < 2 hours.   

<span style="font-size:larger;">🔋</span>**Batteries included**: the basics are covered, but more advanced notions are also available as asides  

<span style="font-size:larger;">🧘‍</span>**Accessible**: devs with little knowledge about browser internals and lower-level languages should be able to read through

<span style="font-size:larger;">⚖️</span>**Unbiased**: multiple sources are used - official documentation, Google dev, Mozilla, independent developers, w3c 

<span style="font-size:larger;">🌱</span>**Evolutive**: this is just the start!  

## Extra 
The `_ideas` file lists talk / blogposts / tools / demo project ideas about Wasm. 

## Sources 
All sources are listed inline.
