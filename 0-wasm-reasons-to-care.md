# Reasons to care

If you're here on this repo, you might already know why WebAssembly is so important.  
But, uhm, you've also opened this page named "Reasons to care".  
No hard feelings. Healthy skeptiscism is healthy.

Let's talk about it.

Myth debunking suit: on.

## Wasm is _not_ just this new hype thing

Well, sure, it's new. And you could argue it's hype. Also, it can be defined as a thing.

But here is the twist: WebAssembly is both _highly transformative_ and _here to stay_.

Picture yourself, on a weekday morning, opening your tech newsletters.
A new tool/framework is making the headlines.  
Pick your path:

1. Laugh and burn these pixels
2. Keep that tool/framework in mind, grow a self-sufficient garden, and come back to it later when it has actually taken off. Early tech = unsure survival => Why invest your time learning about a tech that might die soon anyway, when you could instead go on and learn about React hooks?
3. You're in a good mood. It catches your attention, you give it a try, you love it, you adopt it. Until the next best tool comes in, in which case you might go for option 1.

The WebAssembly case is to this situation what a litchee peel is to black holes - Unrelated.

Why?

1. It's a matter of space

2. There's early and early

A matter of scale

Understand Wasm is not a new framework. It's a whole new universe. Don;t get fooled "it's super new"... "just an MVP"
and it will influence how we build for the web

<!-- , why should I learn about it, "I've just gotten along with React hooks and my inbox is flooded with web news". -->

Well, I've heard about it but that's only for games, right?

<!-- which you could hesitate to learn because it's just hype.
It's an actual new tool that's embedded in browsers.
It's as serious as the new ES6 syntax was, or as any cross-browser feature. -->

Why should you, a honest web developer who's solid on her tools, care about WebAssembly?
