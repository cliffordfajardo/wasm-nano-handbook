# Why am I reading this

Yes, why?

Why would developers want to learn about WebAssembly (Wasm for short)?

If you're here, you might already know why Wasm will be key for web developers and their peers.

Yet you've also opened this page named "Why am I reading this". Not jumping to conclusions here, but you might have your doubts!

Let's talk about it.

**Wasm is not just a new hype thing.**

Yes, it's new.  
And you could argue it has a hype touch to it.  
(Also, it can be described as a thing - it doesn't mean it should, but words belong everybody)

But: WebAssembly is both **highly transformative** and **here to stay**.

Picture yourself, on a weekday morning, opening your tech newsletters.
A new tool/framework is making the headlines.  
What do you do?

1. Laugh and burn these pixels
2. Keep that tool/framework in mind, and come back to it later when it has taken off. Early tech = Uncertain survival => Why invest your time in it if it might fade out soon anyways?
3. You're in a good mood. It catches your attention, you give it a try, you love it, you adopt it. Until the next best tool comes in, in which case you might go for option 1.

WebAssembly is to this tool/framework what the moon is to a street lamp - they look the same from afar, but really they're not.

So, why is Wasm different?

## 1. It's not just fast

## 2. A matter of space

Wasm doesn't make assumptions about the environment it's running in - which is a powerful feature.  
Now let's look to the other side, at the environments in which Wasm support is now built-in: among others, **all 4 major browsers**.

A technology that is now supported by the most ubiquitous pieces fof software is here to stay.

- they know what they're doing
- it will permeate

So, the possibility of Wasm is already there.
it's part of the platform.  
backed with w3c
In that sense, Wasm APIs like the `fetch` API

## 3. There's "early" and "early"

When learning about Wasm, you might have seen/heard the terms "MVP" and "early". It is indeed a young technology - but don't let these words fool you.  
Wasm has been shipped to production, and its development plans are very solid. Look at the spec:

## 4. No borders to be seen

Wasm doesn't make assumptions about the environment it's running in.
also it's a compilation target.

## 5. Looking under the hood

Understanding Wasm goes hand-in-hand with understanding at a high-level how browsers execute JavaScript code. Not just the event loop and the callback queue, but really how JS is transformed at runtime and tun.

And isn't this the core of web development?

So if this is still a bit of a black box to you, Wasm will make this clearer. -->
