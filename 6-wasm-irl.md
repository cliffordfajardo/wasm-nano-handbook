# Wasm in real life // ðŸš§WIP

- Source Maps with Rust and WebAssembly: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/oxidizing-source-maps-with-rust-and-webassembly/  (also done in Chrome) 
- SketchUp: brought to the web in 3 months, via Wasm+emscripten    // https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgOGZgAPUjQ   
- Google Earth: also using threads, way less jank (dropped frames) // https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgOGZgAPUjQ 
- Soundation (music): using threads  // https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgOGZgAPUjQ   
- Gaming/Unity: Unity has switched to WebAssembly as the output format for the Unity WebGL build target. See for example Tanks: https://webassembly.org/demo/ + also see https://hub.packtpub.com/unity-switches-to-webassembly-as-the-output-format-for-the-unity-webgl-build-target/


NB: Interesting examples are where the complexities of JS and WASM interfacing is minimised, since WASM is still young.
