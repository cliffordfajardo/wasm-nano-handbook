# wasm-nano-handbook

ðŸš§ **!!! WIP** ðŸš§ 
 
-----

Wasm is a large territory to explore.  

This handbook aims at helping developers, **no matter their background**:
* **understand** Wasm and its future // the theory
* **get started** with it today  // the practice

### DNA 
Wasm nano handbook strive to be: 
* Nano: as nano as possible for such a big topic as Wasm :) This handbook is split up in small modular chunks, categorized as core or asides.
* Accessible: dev with little knowledge about browser internals and lower-level languages should be able to understand it
* Comprehensive: covers the basics but also more advanced notions (progressively, in an appendix)
* Unbiased: multiple sources are used - official documentation, Google dev, Mozilla, independent developers, w3c
* Evolutive: this is just the start!  

### Extra 
The `_ideas` file lists talk / blogposts / tools / demo project ideas about Wasm. 

### Sources 
All sources are listed inline.
