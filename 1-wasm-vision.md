## Origins   

### Dark times

OK, that's overdramatic - The web is great, and JS is great!   

But they're not perfect.    

When building and running web apps, we must face two significant constraints:  

* (1) Browsers, one of the most ubiquitous piece of software, can only be targeted with **one single language**: JavaScript. Or so was it, until recently.
* (2) JS loads and runs **slower** than native code.   

When you look at the web today, these might not seem like huge issues. Web apps are running, the world is using them, and JS developers won't go extinct. Right?   

Yes. But it's not about today ; it's a bout the delta. Compare what the web is today with the _what the web could become_.   
It suddenly makes a lot of sense to break free of these constraints.   


Let's take a closer look at how of (1) and (2) impact both the developer experience and the user experience:    
* Web apps can get slow.   
* Some use cases are simply supported on the web. This is an extension of the previous point: infinitely slow is just not an option.  
* Our CPUs are under stress. Because JS used to run very slowly, browser engines teams have designed advanced optimization techniques to make it run faster, such as JIT (Just-in-Time compiling ; more on that later / TBD link. If you don't know what this is, no worries, we'll cover that later). This proved very effective: JS today runs manyfold faster that it used too - it was a huge leap. But nothing comes for free. Running JS fast is resource-intensive, especially on smaller devices such as smartphones.    
* The power of millions of native developers is not leveraged for the web.   
* The JS toolchain is convoluted. There are a ton of tools out there that help us developers deliver JS code fast, and to help it run faster. A ton.

### Solution

Previous attempts to solve (1) and (2) have brought use forward, but their success was always mitigated: there was a performance gain but it wasn't consistent, the approach worked but not on all browsers, or it didn't work well cross-platforms e.g. on mobile devices. (TBD link)  

### Re:Solution 

But the people and organizations working on these approaches learned a lot.    

Later on, they joined forces to find a sustainable, cross-browsers, cross-platforms solution to (1) and (2): **WebAssembly, or Wasm for short**.  

**So, Wasm is born for the web.**    

But in fact, there is way more to it - because it's also a compilation target, **its impact go way beyond the web**.    


## So: What is Wasm?

**Wasm is an efficient, low-level assembly-like language / bytecode,** that:   
(1) runs on all modern browsers (2) at near-native speed    
and   
(3) is a compilation target for a wide range of other languages.


Core features:
- performant // it runs at near-native-speed, in a way it's a shortcut to the JS engine's optimizer
- portable // it's a compilation target for a wide range of other languages such as C++ and Rust
- safe // no memory overflow 
- standardized // there's consensus around it

Plus: 
- has bindings that enable that code to access the capabilities of the browser / of JS

## Why can it run anywhere? / Why is it so portable?

Wasm could be used as a portable binary format on many platforms, bringing great benefits in portability, tooling and language-agnosticity.

https://webassembly.org/docs/non-web/

Because:

- it runs on the web (JS VM supports Wasm), which is on a lot of platforms 
- Non-Web environments may include JavaScript VMs (e.g. node.js), however WebAssembly is also being designed to be capable of being executed without a JavaScript VM present. 
-  it takes advantage of common hardware capabilities available on a wide range of platforms, including mobile and IoT.
 - the plan is to keep non-Web path such that it doesnâ€™t require Web APIs (the core features will be within Wasm itself: certain features that are core to Wasm semantics that are similar to functions found in native libc would be part of the core Wasm spec as primitive operators)
 - because it's closer to machine language (it supports C/C++ level semantics), VMs are easier to implement on multiple platforms
 - There is even a project for a cross-platform Wasm virtual machine: Life is written in Go, built for running computationally heavy code on practically any device you can imagine. 
- its AMI is platform-agnostic: 
WebAssembly does not specify any APIs or syscalls, only an import mechanism where the set of available imports is defined by the host environment. In a Web environment, functionality is accessed through the Web APIs defined by the Web Platform. Non-Web environments can choose to implement standard Web APIs, standard non-Web APIs (e.g. POSIX), or invent their own.

e.g. on servers in datacenters, on IoT devices, or mobile/desktop apps, or even embedded within larger programs. 



## Why it will change the world? / Benefits

1) UX: Wasm will make (the web) faster
WebAssembly Parallelism 
https://zendev.com/2018/06/26/webassembly-accelerating-future-web-development.html   

2) Wasm will accelerate the future of web development  
* New performance-demanding use cases become accessible to the web
* New libraries become accessible to the web
* Wasm breaks down the JS monopoly... 
Wasm enables linguistic diversity ; this will dramatically diversify the languages available for building front-end applications and tools. Web development will become accessible to developers coming from other languages ; JS developers will benefit from their experience, and inversely.
* ... and helps JS win   
Wasm will grow to include lots and lots of expressiveness for lots and lots of languages, JS included. 
With shared array buffer extension, eventually all the browsers and webviews will support Wasm syntax to serve the compile target master, and free JS so it can serve the JS master.
* Wasm can be used as a laboratory for the future of the web

3) DevX: Wasm could make our lives easier
Not just on the web! Languages interop is complicated, and Wasm can help.  
Developer experience: no more tower of Babel

4) More

## Wasm use cases

- web: heavily CPU-bound number computations e.g. games (via opengl)
- web: Deliver existing C/C++/... applications over the web (Talking about things like games, 3D Graphics and more) 
- web: Accelerate hot code portions of ordinary JavaScript apps 
- web/others: you'll be consuming compiled binaries
- web/others: Develop in your language of choice (for example .NET or Java).

## Past of Wasm 

Projects such as ASM.js and PNaCl have paved the way to Wasm.  

* 2015: Wasm community group
* 2017: cross-browser consensus
* 2018: draft of the specification 1.0: core spec (=syntax, naming, building, validayion, execution + the standard for the binary format ie types and values), JS interface (interactions between Wasm modules and JS, data storage, sandboxing), web API (rules about module compilation and interactions between the dom and the Wasm modules).

## Wasm today

* Wasm 1.0 is an MVP, that has shipped in 4 major browser engines. 
* It is still early stage: no native strings nor exception handling ; these can be emulated within the basic Wasm but the resulting code is slow. Also, interop between for example JS and Wasm is still complex (calling functions is easy, but itâ€™s the types to send back and forth that is the challenge)

## Future of Wasm

### Future

#### Near

Features planned for Wasm 2.0:  
* multi-threading model and garbage collection // C# and Java support will become easier
* multi-value returns
* host binding // JS objects will be more easily exposed to Wasm 

#### Distant

Once all the browsers support both Wasm and ASM.js, then Wasm can start to grow extra semantics that need not be put into JS.
They may in fact be put into both JavaScript and Wasm because itâ€™s the same one engine (1vm). But there are certain things we might not want to ever put into JS that could be put into Wasm:
- shared memory array buffers to get multi-threaded games. Too complicated for JS: risk for race conditions in JavaScript, fragile process with bug hazards
- zero cost exceptions might not make sense in JavaScript. They require some compiler and runtime cleverness, but they do make sense for C++, and Swift. Might benefit other languages like C++ or Haskell
- call/cc (call-with-current-continuation). Call/cc is too powerful a tool. It has challenges for JS engines in implementation and security hazards. You have these non-local functional gotos. You can call a continuation and be off in a different stack. So itâ€™s not like the local, limited continuations like we have in generators in ES6. Itâ€™s a deeper continuation. So call/cc could be put into Wasm, into the engine that handles both Wasm and JavaScript down the road.
