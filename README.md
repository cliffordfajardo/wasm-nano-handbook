# wasm-nano-handbook 🚧 WIP

Wasm is a large territory to explore.  

This handbook aims at helping developers, **no matter their background**:
* **Understand** Wasm and its future // the theory
* **Use** it today  // the practice  
in a time-efficient way.

### DNA 
Wasm-nano-handbook strive to be:  

<span style="font-size:larger;">📦</span>**Nano**: as nano as possible for such a wide topic :) The content is split up in small modular chunks, categorized as core or asides  

<span style="font-size:larger;">🧘‍</span>**Accessible**: devs with little knowledge about browser internals and lower-level languages should be equipped to understand it  

<span style="font-size:larger;">🔋</span>**Comprehensive**: the basics are covered, but more advanced notions are also available as asides  

<span style="font-size:larger;">⚖️</span>**Unbiased**: multiple sources are used - official documentation, Google dev, Mozilla, independent developers, w3c 

<span style="font-size:larger;">🌱</span>**Evolutive**: this is just the start!  

### Extra 
The `_ideas` file lists talk / blogposts / tools / demo project ideas about Wasm. 

### Sources 
All sources are listed inline.
