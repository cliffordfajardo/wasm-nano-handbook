## âš¡ TL;DR

Wasm looks very different from JS. What makes it different is also what makes it fast.  
But you don't need to be able to write Wasm directly to benefit from it.

## Wasm is Assembly

ðŸ’¡ [What is Assembly?](https://github.com/maudnals/wasm-nano-handbook/blob/master/asides/aside-languages.md)

Basics:

- Assembly is "symbolic machine code" i.e. human-readable.
- Assembly code normally depends on the machine type But when delivering code on a user's machine across the web, we don't know what the target architecture will be. So, Wasm is a special assembly: **it's a machine language for a VM**.
- Wasm is a rather simple kind of Assembly.

// TBD add schema + source.

## WASM is a stack machine

// TBD add illustration

1. WASM is a **stack machine** language.

- A **stack** is a LIFO (last in first out) data structure that has two operations: push and pop.
- A **stack machine** is a stack for which items are instructions, which run and evaluate, and push and pop values on this stack. e.g.: a call stack.

Basic stack example:

```wasm
i32.const 1 // Add 1 to the stack
i32.const 2 // Add 2 to the stack
i32.add // Call add, that takes 2 args, by just popping them off the stack
call $log // Push the result onto the stack"
```

**What's the point of stack machines?**
It's a model on how the code will be run.

WASM implements a stack-machine ; it is a virtual stack and not the program stack.

1. WASM supports **4 types**.  
   2 integer types and 2 floating point types.  
   To model strings, one would share the same piece of linear memory ; for example in the web, memory that can be read from and written to from both WASM and JS.

2. Code is organized into separate **functions**.

3. A WASM binary takes the form of a **module**, that has:

- Function: index of functions defined in this module
- Type: functions signatures defined in thie module
- Code: tha actual function bodies
- Import/export functionalities
- Can also define a start function that is automatically executed.

5. A WASM implementation will typically be embedded into a **host environment**.  
   This environment defines how loading of modules and import/exports work.

## Two shapes

- "Binary" format: for the VM
- Text format: for humans

### "Binary" format: .wasm

"Binary" ... actually hexa
"Dense linear encoding of the abstract syntax" i.e. efficient form of binary that allows for fast decoding, small file size, and reduced memory usage.  
Good for: network transfer, use by JS engine (which will only need to decode it).

```wasm
... TBD
```

Opcodes are represented as bytes, e.g.:
`0x6a` // add operation.

Remember: Assembly code (e.g. WASM) is VM-specific.

### Text format: .wat

.wat is the human-readable form of .wasm. Itâ€™s a light syntactic sugar ; the text format and the binary format map almost 1:1.  
Good for: humans. E.g. source maps (browsers display "wasm" but it reality what you see is "wat")

```
(call $log
	(i32.add
		(i32.const 1)
		(i32.const 2)
	)
)
```

- Opcodes are represented as mnemonics instead of bytes.
- S-expressions are used. Code written in s-expressions can be concisely expressed in a tree structure, which is why s-expressions were chosen for WebAssemblyâ€™s text format.

### The abstract syntax tree (AST)

... is not a format in itself. It's the "underlying logic" of the code.
.wat and .wasm both map 1-1 to the abstract syntax tree.

## Module

A module is the "distributable, loadable, and executable unit of code in WebAssembly" - the packaged version, if you will.
At runtime, a module can be instantiated with a set of import values to produce an instance.

WebAssembly modules are distributed in a binary format.  
Decoding processes that format and converts it into an internal representation of a module.
In the spec, this representation is modelled by abstract syntax, but a real implementation could compile directly to machine code instead.
