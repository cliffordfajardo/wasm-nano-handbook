Machines and humans don't speak the same language.

- You write your code in a language you understand.
- What you wrote needs to be translated at some point into something the machine can understand.

Let's have a look at the spectrum of languages, between human and machines, and what they're good for.

## Human to metal

### Basics

Machine code = Native code ~= binary = the actual bytes (as instructions) that the CPU executes. Each machine code instruction causes the CPU to perform a very specific task: a load, a jump, or an ALU (arithmetic logic unit) operation on a unit of data in a CPU register or memory.
**Machine code depends on the machine's architecture.**
Example:

```javascript
1111; // in binary (base 2)
```

High-level language = what language you write your code in. A high-level language can be more or less high-level. C++ is considered lower-level than JS, because you need to be a little more explicit about how you manage memory, for example. We'll come back to that.
Example: JS, Rust

```javascript
const a = ' Hello ';
const b = a.trim();
```

Basic workflow:

- Write your code in C++
- Compile it ahead-of-time into a binary
- Give the binary to the machine, and let it run it.

### With VMs

Now that this is clear, let's have a look at how virtual machines fit in.  
Warning: this term is overloaded. What we'll talk about is not:

- VMs such as docker
- LLVM: it's more of a compile time VM.

Instead, we'll focus on runtime virtual machines.
Machine code is hardware-dependent.  
But because you don't want to target multiple physical architectures i.e. you want to be portable, you can instead add another layer. This layer is the virtual machine (VM): an abstraction over multiple kinds of machines.

VM usually refers to both:

- what runs your code
- facilities that are needed to run your code.

For example, V8 is an engine that can run JS code. Think of an engine as a specific kind of VM.  
V8 provides the event loop and other APIs needed by JS.  
NB: On top of that, comes the concept of the host - we'll touch on this later.

Example:

- SpiderMonkey, Chakra

## Let's talk about timing

So whenever you write code, it needs to be translated (= compiled) at some point into machine code.

_When_ this translation happens matters: it impacts the developer experience and how your program runs. Different approaches fit different use cases.

AOT. "AOT" really could be called AORT, ie ahead of Runtime.
Example:

- C++ is usually compiled down to binary
- LLVM-compiled WebAssembly. Note that in that case, there will be one more step at runtime: the JS/wasm engine will compile it to machine code and run it. We don't care yet whether Ignition or Turbofan or LiftOff will take care of it - the core idea is is that

If you don't compile it ahead of time:

- your destination needs to be able to compile it.
- your destination will need to compile it, which might take time

JIT
Example:

- Turbofan

Interpretation
...is usually not referred to as a compilation. But some compilation happens for sure!
If you ship JS to the browser, the engine will need at some point to translate it to machine code! So the interpreter also does some compilation.

## Compilers

## Terminology

- "Executable": an overloaded term, that means "something the computer can run". It can be meant as "machine code", or "anything I can run on the computer provided that the runtime is also installed", e.g. a Ruby or Rust script.
- Machine code:
- Engine: a special kind of virtual machine.

## Disambiguations

- You might hear that "WebAssembly is a VM". What that means is that WebAssembly is a language that can run in a VM.

## Flows

JS:

- you write JS // high-level
- JS is shipped as is over to the browser. In a compressed (gzipped), minified (uglified) format - but it's still text //
- The engine runs it:
  - The interpreter (Ignition) runs some portions, via its internal assembly. Note that this will also need to be compiled down to machine code at some point!
  - The optimizing compiler optimizes and runs hot portions.

### Machine code

= Native code ~= binary = the actual bytes (as instructions) that the CPU executes. Each machine code instruction causes the CPU to perform a very specific task: a load, a jump, or an ALU (arithmetic logic unit) operation on a unit of data in a CPU register or memory.
Example:
`1111` // in binary (base 2)
`F` // same binary in hexadecimal i.e. base 16 (but still referred to "binary" as oversimplification). hexa is often used because it takes less space than binary, so errors are less likely.

### Bytecode

= compiled code that targets a virtual machine (rather than a specific computer architecture). Contrary to binaries, bytecode isn't machine code.

But (!!! to check): it can look like it.
Example: xxxx todo

### Assembly language

= ASM = "symbolic machine code"

Language that is human-readable, but still closely associated with machine code instructions. Each assembly language (except WASM I think) is specific to a particular computer architecture and operating system. In contrast, most high-level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling.
NB: Bytecode and assembly language are similar: not high-level but readable ; both are "intermediate languages" between source code and machine code. Main difference: bytecode is generated for a virtual machine (software), while assembly language is created for a CPU (hardware). Src: https://techterms.com/definition/bytecode
Example:
A C compiler generates native machine code for a native machine architecture.
In the most common implementations, some python code (somefile.py) when imported creates a file (somefile.pyc) in the same directory; this is bytecode that will be run by the python VM. So python is semi-compiled (compiled invisibly).
There is yet another concept called JIT, where code is actually compiled to native machine code on the fly.
Also, there is interpreted: Ruby is no doubt an interpreted language since the source code is processed by an interpreter at the point of execution.

### High-level language

E.g. JS, Rust, ...  
Example:

```javascript
const a = ' Hello ';
const b = a.trim();
```

Workflow:
Programmer writes high-level language OR assembly language, that is then compiled to executable machine code (by a compiler or assembler, respectively).
NB: interpreted programs are an exception, they're not compiled to machine code.
