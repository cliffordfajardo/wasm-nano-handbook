## Code format

<------------------------------------------------------------>
human-readable ----------------------------- not human-readable
high-level low-level
not executable by CPU executable by CPU
"source code"

### Machine code

= Native code ~= binary = the actual bytes (as instructions) that the CPU executes. Each machine code instruction causes the CPU to perform a very specific task: a load, a jump, or an ALU (arithmetic logic unit) operation on a unit of data in a CPU register or memory.
Example:
`1111` // in binary (base 2)
`F` // same binary in hexadecimal i.e. base 16 (but still referred to "binary" as oversimplification). hexa is often used because it takes less space than binary, so errors are less likely.

### Bytecode

= compiled code that targets a virtual machine (rather than a specific computer architecture). Contrary to binaries, bytecode isn't machine code.

But (!!! to check): it can look like it.
Example: xxxx todo

### Assembly language

= ASM = "symbolic machine code"

Language that is human-readable, but still closely associated with machine code instructions. Each assembly language (except WASM I think) is specific to a particular computer architecture and operating system. In contrast, most high-level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling.
NB: Bytecode and assembly language are similar: not high-level but readable ; both are "intermediate languages" between source code and machine code. Main difference: bytecode is generated for a virtual machine (software), while assembly language is created for a CPU (hardware). Src: https://techterms.com/definition/bytecode
Example:
A C compiler generates native machine code for a native machine architecture.
In the most common implementations, some python code (somefile.py) when imported creates a file (somefile.pyc) in the same directory; this is bytecode that will be run by the python VM. So python is semi-compiled (compiled invisibly).
There is yet another concept called JIT, where code is actually compiled to native machine code on the fly.
Also, there is interpreted: Ruby is no doubt an interpreted language since the source code is processed by an interpreter at the point of execution.

`A* name$i`

### High-level language

E.g. JS, Rust, ...  
Example:

```javascript
const a = ' Hello ';
const b = a.trim();
```

Workflow:
Programmer writes high-level language OR assembly language, that is then compiled to executable machine code (by a compiler or assembler, respectively).
NB: interpreted programs are an exception, they're not comnpiled to machine code.

NB:
Executable = something the computer can run.
Can be meant as...
Machine code // 01010100100001
OR
"anything I can run on the computer provided that the runtime is also installed" // e.g. a ruby or rust script.

* statically typed language: each variable's type is determined at compile time and not run-time 
* strongly typed: the language is strict about what should be typed ; ( (the interpreter keeps track of all variables types)
