# wasm-nano-handbook 🚧 WIP

Wasm is a large territory to explore.  

This handbook aims at helping developers, **no matter their background**:
* **understand** Wasm and its future // the theory
* **get started** with it today  // the practice

### DNA 
Wasm-nano-handbook strive to be:  

* <span style="font-size:larger;">📦</span> Nano: as nano as possible for such a big topic as Wasm :) This handbook is split up in small modular chunks, categorized as core or asides.
* <span style="font-size:larger;">🧘‍</span>  Accessible: dev with little knowledge about browser internals and lower-level languages should be able to understand it
* <span style="font-size:larger;">🔋</span>  Comprehensive: covers the basics, and make more advanced notions available as asides
* <span style="font-size:larger;">⚖️</span>  Unbiased: multiple sources are used - official documentation, Google dev, Mozilla, independent developers, w3c
* <span style="font-size:larger;">🌱</span>  Evolutive: this is just the start!  

### Extra
